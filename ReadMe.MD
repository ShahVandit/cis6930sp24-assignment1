# Censoror by Vandit Shah
## Overview of the Text Censorship Tool

The Text Censorship Tool is a powerful Python script designed to help users protect privacy and comply with data protection regulations by automatically detecting and censoring sensitive information within text files. It is capable of processing a large volume of data efficiently, making it ideal for both individual and organizational use.

## Key Features

- **Sensitive Information Censorship**: The tool can identify and redact various types of sensitive information, including personal names, dates, phone numbers, and addresses. This makes it versatile for different data privacy needs.

- **Customizable Censorship Options**: Users have the flexibility to specify which types of sensitive information to censor, allowing for tailored data protection strategies.

- **Advanced Text Analysis**: Utilizing the Spacy NLP library and regular expressions, the tool offers accurate detection of sensitive information, ensuring reliable censorship across diverse text formats.

- **Statistics Reporting**: After processing, the tool provides detailed statistics on the censored information, offering insights into the extent of data redaction performed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Pipenv for managing project dependencies.


## Running Instructions
To use the text censorship script, you must have Python installed on your system along with the spacy library and its en_core_web_md model. If you haven't installed spacy or the model yet, you can do so using the following commands:

pipenv install
Once you have the prerequisites installed, you can run the script using the following command syntax:

pipenv run python censoror.py --input '*.txt' \
                    --names --dates --phones --address\
                    --output 'files/' \
                    --stats stderr

Command-line Arguments:

--input: Specify input files using glob patterns.
--output: Directory where redacted files will be saved.
--names, --dates, --phones, --address: Toggle redaction for specific data types.
--stats: Output destination for process statistics (stderr, stdout, or filepath).

## Bugs & Assumptions
Bugs: The script assumes well-formed input according to the specified patterns. Malformed dates, phone numbers, addresses, or names might not be detected and censored correctly.
Assumptions: The script assumes English text input and uses specific patterns for dates, phone numbers, addresses, and names common in English-speaking countries. It may not work as expected for texts in other languages or with different formatting conventions.


## Function Descriptions
### Create: `censor` Function

#### Purpose
To censor specified types of sensitive information within a given text, including dates, phone numbers, addresses, names, and email-like patterns.

#### Parameters
- `text`: The text content to be censored.
- `censor_names`, `censor_dates`, `censor_phones`, `censor_address`: Boolean flags indicating which types of information to censor.
- `stats`: A `Counter` object for collecting statistics on the censored information.

#### Process
- Utilizes regular expressions to find and replace dates, phone numbers, and addresses with censorship markers (e.g., â–ˆ characters).
- Employs the spacy NLP library to identify and censor personal names.
- Updates the `stats` object with counts of each type of censored information.

#### Returns
- The censored text and updated `local_stats` as a `Counter` object.

### Populate/Insert: `process_files` Function

#### Purpose
To process multiple files, censoring the specified types of sensitive information in each file.

#### Parameters
- `input_patterns`: List of glob patterns for matching input files.
- `output_dir`: Directory where censored files will be saved.
- `censor_flags`: A dictionary of flags indicating which types of information to censor.
- `stats_output`: Specifies where to output the censorship statistics (stderr, stdout, or a file path).

#### Process
- Iterates over all files matched by the input patterns, reading and censoring each file's content based on the specified flags.
- Saves the censored content to new files in the specified output directory.
- Aggregates and optionally outputs statistics on the censored information.

### Status/Print: `print_stats` Function

#### Purpose
To print or save the statistics collected during the censoring process.

#### Parameters
- `stats`: A `Counter` object containing the aggregated statistics of censored information.
- `detailed_stats`: A dictionary with detailed statistics for each processed file.
- `output_stream`: The output stream (e.g., sys.stderr, sys.stdout, or a file object) where statistics will be written.

#### Process
- Outputs the total counts of censored information types and detailed statistics per file to the specified output stream.


## Test Function Descriptions

### Test Addresses

- **Objective**: To verify that addresses within the text are correctly identified and redacted.
- **Method**: A sample text containing a specific address is processed. The test checks if the resulting text no longer contains the address, indicating successful redaction.

### Test Dates

- **Objective**: To ensure that dates mentioned in any format within the text are accurately detected and censored.
- **Method**: Introduces a text with explicit dates. After processing, the test validates the absence of these dates in the output, confirming their effective redaction.

### Test Names

- **Objective**: To confirm that personal names are properly recognized and anonymized in the processed text.
- **Method**: Uses input text with clear mention of names. Post-censorship, the test asserts that these names are not present, proving their successful removal.

### Test Phone Numbers

- **Objective**: To assess the tool's capability to identify and obscure phone numbers within the text.
- **Method**: A text containing phone numbers is processed. The test then checks for the absence of these numbers in the censored output, indicating correct function.
